Maybe add the derivation from the MA 

Check whether we need the template$<$int dim$>$ for some reason
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Initialise the instance with the initial load increment {\itshape initial\+\_\+increment} (applied in the first load step), the driver (Neumann=1, Dirichlet=2) that applies the load and the number of dofs per cell {\itshape dofs\+\_\+per\+\_\+cell} (e.\+g. from {\itshape fe.\+dofs\+\_\+per\+\_\+cell}) 
\end{DoxyItemize}

Add the example from the MA with the pictures
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Compute the constraint equation (derived from the energy increment) 
\end{DoxyItemize}

Try to merge the two solve\+\_\+linear\+\_\+systemX functions

Format the code below, use subheadings, etc.

clean up the documentation of the classes

use boldsymbol for tensors

It would be nice to use the data types from the Sacado\+\_\+\+Wrapper for all the Sacado variables. But somehow the operators (multiply$\ast$, ...) seem to cause conflicts again.

Maybe add some more text on the linearization 

try to merge the fad\+\_\+double data type with this templated data type 

Add the link to the ac.\+nz site
